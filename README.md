# restaurant_page

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page">Manita Pizza !</a>

This was my first use of Webpack here ! I used the name of a friend restaurant and i'm still waiting for the pictures to complete it.

I've learned about replaceChildren() to switch the different pages. 
A fun one !
